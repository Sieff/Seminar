	Anim:	
		Start with unit square
		Add Points
		Draw a packing
	Folien:
		Conjecture
		Target
Construction of packings
	Folien:
		Ordering
		Greedy Strategy
	Anim:
		Dominance order
		Rectangle Definition
		Tiling
		Tilepacking
		Lemma: Greedy better than Tilepacking
		Proof
		Remark: Will use tilepacking because of its properties, but greedy will be strictly better and is more 'easy' to execute
Analysis of Tilepacking
	Folien:
		Define phi as worst case performance
		Define beta, beta tiles, F(beta, lambda)
Properties of a beta tile
	Anim:
		Notation for beta tiles
		Lemma: Upper bound for area of beta tile
		proof
		Sectors and tips (+ main body + notations)
		Lemma: Width of tips is at least the width of main body, thus total width is more than twice the main bodys width (same for vertical variant)
		Proof
		Tall and wide Tiles
Upper bound on the total area of beta tiles
	Anim:
		Lemma: The triangle do not contain any points from S
		Proof
		Lemma: Every trapezoid lies in a specific polygon
		proof
		Bound for area of wide for pairwise disjoint trapezoids
		The general case for overlappings
		Lemma: For overlapping trapezoids, the lower one is significantly larger
		Charging scheme
		Lemma: Bound for total charge
		proof
		Bringing it all together
